# Rendered Instruction Context

Status: pass

- Counts cover deterministic rendered rd-skills instructions and canonical Capsules rendered from versioned checked-in fixture data, not a host-observed model request.
- Counts exclude host system prompts, tool schemas, user conversation history, repository reads, diffs, command output, and other dynamic evidence.
- Host loaders may transform Profile or Skill files and may expose discovery metadata differently; this report does not prove real-host accuracy.
- Token counts do not prove wall-clock performance, production accuracy, Profile startup, or the installed user experience.
- Duplicate-token measurement detects exact normalized Markdown rule blocks, not semantic paraphrases.
- Nested Layer 3 Reference counts include only explicitly named fixture files; directories, indexes, catalogs, and recursively linked files are never loaded.
